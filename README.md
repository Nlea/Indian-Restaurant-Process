# Indian-Restaurant-Process

This is the process I showed during the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuEFufhSvg) at the [*WTF is cloud native conference*](https://www.cloud-native-conf.wtf/). 

It is implemented in [Camunda Cloud](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/what-is-camunda-cloud/). You can find the BPMN Diagramm in here and in the folders the Node Workers that I used.

In order to run the project you need to create a [Camunda Cloud Account](https://console.cloud.camunda.io/) and set up a [cluster](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/cloud-console/manage-clusters/create-cluster/) in the Camunda [Cloud console](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/cloud-console/introduction/). 

## Deploying the process  
To run the project deploy the bpmn diagramm from this repo to Camunda Cloud. You can do so by using the Cloud Modeler and [import](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/cloud-modeler/import-diagram/) the bpmn file and [deploy](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/cloud-modeler/save-and-deploy/) it from there.

There are other options too:
- You can use the [Camunda Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) 
- You can use a [client library](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/java-client-examples/process-deploy/)
- You can [build an own client](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/build-your-own-client/) to deploy a process  

‚ùó If you use one of the alternative options you need to set up [client connection credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/getting-started/setup-client-connection-credentials/)

## Start a process instance
You can [start an instance](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/cloud-modeler/start-instance/) of your process using the Cloud Modeler. 

There are other options too: 
- You can use the [Camunda Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) 
- You can use a [client library](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/java-client-examples/process-instance-create/)
- You can [build an own client](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/build-your-own-client/#authentication-via-oauth)  

‚ùó If you use one of the alternative options you need to set up [client connection credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/getting-started/setup-client-connection-credentials/)


üëÄ Once you started a process Instance you can overview the state in [Operate](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/operate/index/)


## Running the Job workers

In order to change the state of the process. You need to run the job workers from this repo and connect them to your Camunda Cloud Cluster. 
1. [Set up client connection credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/getting-started/setup-client-connection-credentials/)
2. Create a .env file in the workers directory and paste in your credentials  
```
ZEEBE_ADDRESS='xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx-x.zeebe.camunda.io:xxx'
ZEEBE_CLIENT_ID='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECRET='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
ZEEBE_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_URL='https://login.cloud.camunda.io/oauth/token'
```
3. Install all the needed packages in order to run the Node clients: 
- The workers are written in JS make sure you have [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed
- The workers use [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node#overview) so make sure you have it installed
- In order to read the credentials from the .env file you need the [Dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): ```npm install dotenv```   
- In order to connect to Camunda Cloud the Workers uses the [JS Client library](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/community-clients/javascript/) ```npm install zeebe-node ``` 

4. Run the workers: Naviage to the folder of the workers and start them by using ```ts-node src/WORKERSNAME.ts ``` 
5. üëÄ Observe the console of the workers and the state of the process in Operate
