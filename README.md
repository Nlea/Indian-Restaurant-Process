# Indian-Restaurant-Process

This is the process I showed during the WTF is cloud native conference. 

It is implemented in [Camunda Cloud](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/what-is-camunda-cloud/). You can find the BPMN Diagramm in here and in the folders the Node Workers that I used.

In order to run the project you need to create a [Camunda Cloud Account](https://console.cloud.camunda.io/) and set up a [cluster](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/cloud-console/manage-clusters/create-cluster/) in the Camunda [Cloud console](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/cloud-console/introduction/). 

## Deploying the process  
To run the project deploy the bpmn diagramm from this repo to Camunda Cloud. You can do so by using the Cloud Modeler and [import](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/cloud-modeler/import-diagram/) the bpmn file and [deploy](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/cloud-modeler/save-and-deploy/) it from there.

There are other options too:
- You can use the [Camunda Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) 
- You can use a [client library](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/java-client-examples/process-deploy/)
- You can [build an own client](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/build-your-own-client/) to deploy a process  

‚ùó If you use one of the alternative options you need to set up [client connection credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/getting-started/setup-client-connection-credentials/)

## Start a process instance
You can [start an instance](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/cloud-modeler/start-instance/) of your process using the Cloud Modeler. 

There are other options too: 
- You can use the [Camunda Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) 
- You can use a [client library](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/java-client-examples/process-instance-create/)
- You can [build an own client](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/build-your-own-client/#authentication-via-oauth)  

‚ùó If you use one of the alternative options you need to set up [client connection credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/getting-started/setup-client-connection-credentials/)


üëÄ Once you started a process Instance you can overview the state in [Operate](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/operate/index/)
